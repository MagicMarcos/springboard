# ðŸŒˆ Springboard

> Your project's first place

![Makefile 100%](https://img.shields.io/badge/Makefile-100%25-brightgreen)

## What is it? 

Springboard is a public website that lists open-source projects collected by creators through pull-requests.

## Why should I contribute?

Finding users who will use your code isn't easy at all. It is even more difficult to find someone to contribute to your project. 
Placing your project on the `projects.list` will help you get a little more visibility.

## Get Started

To be included in the homepage of the site you just need to edit 
the [projects.list](https://github.com/javanile/springboard/edit/main/projects.list) file, create a pull-request, 
it will be approved within an hour from that moment your project will be visible on the site 
until you reach the hundred stars.
